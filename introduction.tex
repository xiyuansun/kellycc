\section{Introduction}

Differential expression exists when the expected value of a phenotype differs from the expected phenotypic values of the other variety. Differential expression can occue if the mean phenotype of a variety is greater than the other variety's or less than the other variety's. I refer to the former as high differential expression (HDE) and the latter as low differential expression (LDE). There is differential expression (DE) if and only if either HDE or LDE holds. Ji et al. \cite{ji2014estimation} introduced an approach to assess gene expression heterosis using microarray data under the assumption that these data are continuous. They built a normal hierarchical model for microarray measurements of transcript abundance that allows borrowing of information across genes to estimate means and variances. They introduced an empirical Bayes framework that first estimates model hyperparameters, then estimates the posterior distribution for gene-specific parameters conditional on those hyperparameters, and finally computes heterosis probabilities based on integrals of regions under this posterior. Building on the work of Ji et al. with the normal data model, Niemi et al. \cite{niemi2015empirical}

The focus here is on methods for count-based differential expression (DE) amalyses. Thus, the starting point here is a count table of features-by-samples, such as those from the Paschold project \cite{paschold2012complementation}.

Considerable recent effort has been paid to the discovery of DE features, given a count table; recent comparisons have shown that no method dominates the spectrum of possible situations \cite{soneson2013comparison}\cite{rapaport2013comprehensive}. 

\section{RNA-Seq Count Data}

RNA-Seq is a next generation sequencing procedure of the entire transcriptome by which one can measure the expression of gene expression. The number of reads mapped to a given gene is considered to be the estimate of the expression level of that feature using the technology. The end product of a RNA-seq experiment is a sequence of read counts, typically represented as a matrix with rows representing genes and columns representing samples from two varieties, as in Table \ref{tab:RNA-Seq Data}. In this example, there are $V=2$ varieties, $J_1 = 2$ samples in the first variety, $J_2=2$ samples in the second variety, and $G=10000$ genes. My interest is in the detection of differentially expressed genes among the varieties.

The focus of this report is to provide a comparison of the methods related to the analysis of differential expression for RNA-seq data. In this report, I review statistical methods for detecting differential expression in the RNA-seq data, including the empirical Bayesian method. I summarize the results of a simulation study. I briefly describe some existing open source R and Bioconductor software for testing differential expression for RNA-seq data. I conclude the report with a discussion section.
